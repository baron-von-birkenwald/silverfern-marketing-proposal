THE FIRST WATERING

A seed cannot grow in darkness alone.

Days pass. The viewer scrolls again. And there we are—another post. A stunning photograph of a rooftop garden. A thread about the philosophy of patience in growing things. A joke about naming your houseplants after venture capitalists.

They smile. They follow.

Now the watering begins.

Every week, we appear in their feed. Not selling. Not pushing. Just being. Sharing the vision of a world where every plant thrives. Celebrating the quiet joy of green things growing. Making them laugh with our satirical takes on startup culture and plant parenthood.

Instagram shows them beauty—interiors transformed by living things, the personality of a well-placed fiddle leaf fig, the drama of a trailing pothos.

X shows them voice—our optimism, our wit, our irreverence. The personality behind the company. The humans who believe in something.

With each post, the seed stirs beneath the soil. Roots begin to form—not toward our product, but toward our worldview. They're not customers yet. They're believers in the making.

The water is consistent. The water is patient. The water never asks for anything in return.

It simply nurtures what was planted.
