## The Vision

> **To participate in the growth of every plant in the world.**

Every post, every campaign, every piece of content ladders up to this idea. The marketing engine we build should radiate this vision across every channel.

## The Customer Journey: An Allegory of Growth

Every customer begins as a seed. Here is how we grow them.

| Stage | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 🌱 **The Seed** | [`seed.txt`](seed.txt) | A single post on Instagram or X plants an idea in someone's mind. No pitch—just a moment of connection. |
| 💧 **The First Watering** | [`watering_vision.txt`](watering_vision.txt) | Consistent presence on Instagram and X nurtures the vision. Beauty, wit, personality. Roots begin to form. |
| 🌿 **The Deeper Watering** | [`watering_product.txt`](watering_product.txt) | LinkedIn credibility, Blindspot visibility, Mailchimp value. The product emerges behind the vision. |
| 🌸 **The First Bloom** | [`reeling_in.txt`](reeling_in.txt) | They sign up. Welcome sequences nurture them. The relationship deepens through every email. |
| 🌺 **The Deepening** | [`deepening.txt`](deepening.txt) | They engage with everything. Open every email. Share our content. Build internal buy-in. |
| 🍎 **The Harvest** | [`harvest.txt`](harvest.txt) | A warm, qualified lead transfers to sales. Trust already established. The cycle begins anew. |

## Two-Track System

| Track | Channels | Purpose |

## Platform Roles

| Platform | Role |

| **X** | Company personality. Plant culture commentary, satirical startup riffs, vision statements. Witty, irreverent, optimistic. |
| **LinkedIn** | Business channel. Product marketing, thought leadership, sponsored content, lead generation. Professional and credible. |
| **Mailchimp** | Nurture engine. Lead capture, welcome sequences, drip campaigns, product announcements, newsletters. |
| **Blindspot** | Strategic visibility. Trade show presence, geographic targeting, brand reinforcement at key moments. |

## AI Content Engine

Use AI to batch-generate large pools of vision-aligned content monthly. Human curation ensures brand fit. Schedule weeks in advance. Result: consistent presence with minimal ongoing effort.

**Monthly workflow:** Generate → Curate → Schedule → Let automation run.

**Time investment:** ~10-15 hours/month instead of daily scrambling.
