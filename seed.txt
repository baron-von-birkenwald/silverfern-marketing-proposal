THE SEED

It begins with a single moment.

A scroll through Instagram. A glance at X. And there it is—an image of a thriving monstera in morning light, a witty observation about why every startup needs a plant mascot, a satirical post about "Series A Ferns."

Something sticks.

Not a sales pitch. Not a product demo. Just a feeling. A recognition. A tiny spark of curiosity planted in the back of the mind.

This is the seed.

The viewer doesn't know our name yet. They don't know what we sell. But they've felt something—a warmth, a humor, a shared love for growing things. They've glimpsed a company that sees the world the way they do.

The seed is buried now. Silent. Waiting.

And we move on to the next scroll, the next viewer, the next moment of connection. Planting seeds everywhere we go.

Because every customer relationship starts the same way every plant does: with something small, something almost invisible, something full of potential.
