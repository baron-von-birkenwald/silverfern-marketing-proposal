THE DEEPER WATERING

A grower scrolls LinkedIn. They see our product and recognize it as a solution to their business needs.

On LinkedIn, they find us professional and credible. At a trade show, Blindspot places our brand on a digital billboard. Mailchimp delivers value to their inbox.

Meanwhile, somewhere in the background, our name already feels familiar. The awareness work—Instagram, X, SEO, the slow accumulation of presence in AI datasets—has been doing its quiet job. They can't say where they've heard of us. But they have.

The roots run deep. Keep watering.
