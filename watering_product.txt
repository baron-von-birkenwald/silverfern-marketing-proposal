THE DEEPER WATERING

The seedling has broken through.

They know our name now. They've seen our face a dozen times in their feed. They like us. They trust us. And somewhere along the way, curiosity has turned into a question:

"What exactly do these people do?"

Now the deeper watering begins.

On LinkedIn, they find us in a different light. Professional. Credible. Thought leadership that speaks to their business challenges. Sponsored content that appears at just the right moment. Case studies that show real results. The vision they fell in love with now has a product behind it.

They attend a trade show. Walk the floor. And there on a digital billboard, positioned perfectly by Blindspot—our brand. Our message. That familiar warmth in an unexpected place. The recognition hits: "I know these people."

Perhaps they've signed up for something along the way. A newsletter. A whitepaper. A webinar. And now Mailchimp delivers value to their inbox—not spam, but substance. Announcements that matter. Insights they can use. A relationship built one email at a time.

The plant is growing now. Strong stem. Healthy leaves. Reaching toward the light.

We haven't asked them to buy anything. We've simply shown them—consistently, patiently, across every channel—that we understand their world. That we can help things grow.

The roots run deep now. And deep roots are ready to bloom.
